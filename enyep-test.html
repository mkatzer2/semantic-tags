      <p>Introduction: The Elma Nakasatsunai Exchange program was founded by Kelly and Mika Katzer in 1994. It is an exchange program for 8th grade students that takes place between Elma, Washington and Nakasatsunai, a small town in the North island of Japan called Hokkaido. Students are given the opportunity to first host a student from Japan (in the spring), and then later in the summer, they themselves stay in a host family's home for two weeks in Japan. In most cases, if possible, they stay at the same student that they hosted in the fall's house.</p>
     
      <p> Some of the things students do during the duration of the program:<br>Interact with students from the opposite school <br>Build close bonds with host family members<br> Learn some basic Japanese phrases <br>Try all sorts of <b>DELICIOUS</b> Japanese Cuisine!

      <p>Update: Unfortunately for various reasons, the program announced its final year in 2015. It lasted a great 21 years full of memorable moments and created numerous life long friendships.
